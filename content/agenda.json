The scope extends beyond the materials of university libraries and museums, delving into the galaxy of research initiatives and materials preserved by both university and non-university institutions made available through specific thematic/disciplinary projects.</p><p>The purpose of this reflection is to initiate a dialogue on forms of cultural heritage sharing that are compatible and interoperable with research infrastructures, fostering fruitful exchanges between cultural institutions and heritage communities with scientific research institutions. This transition into digital infrastructures carries with it a complex experience and activity of integrating semantic relationships from diverse scientific and educational fields preceding the digital era.</p><p>Discussions will revolve around how universities can facilitate the valorization of cultural heritage through digital research infrastructures, not only limited to their own heritage but also stimulating interoperability with other local and international initiatives. It will encourage synergies on common interests such as long-term preservation, innovative forms of participation, citizen science, storytelling, open licenses, etc.</p><p>Further reflections will focus on the flexibility of <span class=\"keyword\">conceptual models </span> for integrating content and metadata, ensuring the potential for interaction with digital research infrastructures structured internationally across various disciplinary domains. This includes the development of new ways to share delivery data and the provision of services, especially in Knowledge Discovery.</p>",
